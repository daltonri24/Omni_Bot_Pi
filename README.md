# Omni_Bot_Pi

This repo contains the code stored on the Raspberry Pi 5 for my omni-bot project. For more information and details on the project as a whole, please look at the [repo pertaining to the code on the PC](https://github.com/daltonri24/Omni_Bot_PC). 


__.devcontainer__ provides the necessary information on the docker file and docker parameters for running ROS2 and the realsense SDK on the RPi 5

__micro_ros_pi__ contains the micro_ROS for RPi Pico SDK. The code I wrote to run on the pico can be found in __pico_controll.cpp__.
